## Day 0: September 24, 2018

**Today's progress:** I have downloaded the data sets, I really want to complete this challange.

**Thoughts:** It is my first project on ML, even I did not finish all courses but I want to practice, I'm really excited.

## Day 1: September 25, 2018

**Today's progress:** Completed week 2 of ML learning courses and week 1 of move 37, still need better understanding of Bellman Equations and values/policies iteration

**Thoughts:** Python is setup on my machine, and I'll start play arround with some code. I should be jumping in ML coding very soon
