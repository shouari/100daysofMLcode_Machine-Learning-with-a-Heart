# 100 Days_LOG:

## Day 0: September 24, 2018

**Today's progress:** I have downloaded the data sets, I really want to complete this challange.

**Thoughts:** It is my first project on ML, even I did not finish all courses but I want to practice, I'm really excited.

## Day 1: September 25, 2018

**Today's progress:** Completed week 2 of ML learning courses and week 1 of move 37, still need better understanding of Bellman Equations and values/policies iteration

**Thoughts:** Python is setup on my machine, and I'll start play arround with some code. I should be jumping in ML coding very soon

## Day 2,3,4,5: September 26,27,28,29, 2018

**progress:** Going through week 3 of Machine Learning courses of Andew Ng, and some tutorials for python (Pandas). As for reinforcement learning (Move 37), I am little stuck with Bellman Equation and MDP, which requires more documentation. 

**Thoughts:** While going through ML courses and improving python, I decided to put reinforcement learning on stand by for more efficiency.
Hopefully, I'll finish week 3 of ML learning courses by 30 Septemeber and start preparing the dataset I'm working on
